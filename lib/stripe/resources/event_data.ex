  * `previous_attributes` - Object containing the names of the updated attributes and their values prior to the event (only included in events of type `*.updated`). If an array attribute has any updated elements, this object contains the entire array. In Stripe API versions 2017-04-06 or earlier, an updated array attribute in this object includes only the updated array elements.
