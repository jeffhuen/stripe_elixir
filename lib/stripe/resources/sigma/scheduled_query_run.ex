  ScheduledQueryRun

  If you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you'll
  receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query
  runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to
  retrieve the query results.
