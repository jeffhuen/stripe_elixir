  PortalSession

  The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and
  billing management.

  A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you
  want to provide to your customers through the portal.

  A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for
  a particular customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer
  can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons,
  sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL.
  Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions
  and billing details.
