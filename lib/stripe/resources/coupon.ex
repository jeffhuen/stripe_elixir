  Coupon

  A coupon contains information about a percent-off or amount-off discount you
  might want to apply to a customer. Coupons may be applied to [subscriptions](https://api.stripe.com#subscriptions), [invoices](https://api.stripe.com#invoices),
  [checkout sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), [quotes](https://api.stripe.com#quotes), and more. Coupons do not work with conventional one-off [charges](https://api.stripe.com#create_charge) or [payment intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents).
  """

  @typedoc """

  * `currency_options` - Coupons defined in each available currency option. Each key must be a three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) and a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). Expandable.
  * `duration` - One of `forever`, `once`, or `repeating`. Describes how long a customer who applies this coupon will get the discount. Possible values: `forever`, `once`, `repeating`.
  * `duration_in_months` - If `duration` is `repeating`, the number of months the coupon applies. Null if coupon `duration` is `forever` or `once`. Nullable.
  * `id` - Unique identifier for the object. Max length: 5000.
  * `livemode` - Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.
  * `max_redemptions` - Maximum number of times this coupon can be redeemed, in total, across all customers, before it is no longer valid. Nullable.
  * `metadata` - Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Nullable.
  * `name` - Name of the coupon displayed to customers on for instance invoices or receipts. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `coupon`.
