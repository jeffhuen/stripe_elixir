  TreasuryOutboundTransfersResourceOutboundTransfer

  Use [OutboundTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers) to transfer funds from a [FinancialAccount](https://api.stripe.com#financial_accounts) to a PaymentMethod belonging to the same entity. To send funds to a different party, use [OutboundPayments](https://api.stripe.com#outbound_payments) instead. You can send funds over ACH rails or through a domestic wire transfer to a user's own external bank account.

  Simulate OutboundTransfer state changes with the `/v1/test_helpers/treasury/outbound_transfers` endpoints. These methods can only be called on test mode objects.

  * `destination_payment_method_details` - Expandable.
  * `expected_arrival_date` - The date when funds are expected to arrive in the destination account. Format: Unix timestamp.
  * `financial_account` - The FinancialAccount that funds were pulled from. Max length: 5000.
  * `hosted_regulatory_receipt_url` - A [hosted transaction receipt](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/regulatory-receipts) URL that is provided when money movement is considered regulated under Stripe's money transmission licenses. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `id` - Unique identifier for the object. Max length: 5000.
  * `livemode` - Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.
  * `metadata` - Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `treasury.outbound_transfer`.
  * `returned_details` - Details about a returned OutboundTransfer. Only set when the status is `returned`. Nullable. Expandable.
