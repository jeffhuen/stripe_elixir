  TreasuryOutboundPaymentsResourceOutboundPayment

  Use [OutboundPayments](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments) to send funds to another party's external bank account or [FinancialAccount](https://api.stripe.com#financial_accounts). To send money to an account belonging to the same user, use an [OutboundTransfer](https://api.stripe.com#outbound_transfers).

  Simulate OutboundPayment state changes with the `/v1/test_helpers/treasury/outbound_payments` endpoints. These methods can only be called on test mode objects.
