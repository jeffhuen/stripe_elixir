  InvoiceItem

  Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices). When you create an invoice item with an `invoice` field, it is attached to the specified invoice and included as [an invoice line item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item) within [invoice.lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).

  Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined
  with a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge
  or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges
  (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

  @typedoc """
  * `amount` - Amount (in the `currency` specified) of the invoice item. This should always be equal to `unit_amount * quantity`.
  * `currency` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). Format: ISO 4217 currency code.

  * `discountable` - If true, discounts will apply to this invoice item. Always false for prorations.

  * `net_amount` - The amount after discounts, but before credits and taxes. This field is `null` for `discountable=true` items.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `invoiceitem`.
