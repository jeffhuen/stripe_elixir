  InvoiceItem

  Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices). When you create an invoice item with an `invoice` field, it is attached to the specified invoice and included as [an invoice line item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item) within [invoice.lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).

  Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined
  with a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge
  or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges
  (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

  @typedoc """
  * `amount` - Amount (in the `currency` specified) of the invoice item. This should always be equal to `unit_amount * quantity`.
  * `currency` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). Format: ISO 4217 currency code.
  * `customer` - The ID of the customer to bill for this invoice item. Expandable.
  * `customer_account` - The ID of the account to bill for this invoice item. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `date` - Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch. Format: Unix timestamp.
  * `description` - An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `discountable` - If true, discounts will apply to this invoice item. Always false for prorations.
  * `discounts` - The discounts which apply to the invoice item. Item discounts are applied before invoice discounts. Use `expand[]=discounts` to expand each discount. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `id` - Unique identifier for the object. Max length: 5000.
  * `invoice` - The ID of the invoice this invoice item belongs to. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `livemode` - Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.
  * `metadata` - Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Nullable.
  * `net_amount` - The amount after discounts, but before credits and taxes. This field is `null` for `discountable=true` items.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `invoiceitem`.
  * `parent` - The parent that generated this invoice item. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `period` - Expandable.
  * `pricing` - The pricing information of the invoice item. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `proration` - Whether the invoice item was created automatically as a proration adjustment when the customer switched plans.
  * `proration_details` - Expandable.
  * `quantity` - Quantity of units for the invoice item. If the invoice item is a proration, the quantity of the subscription that the proration was computed for.
  * `tax_rates` - The tax rates which apply to the invoice item. When set, the `default_tax_rates` on the invoice do not apply to this invoice item. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `test_clock` - ID of the test clock this invoice item belongs to. Nullable. Expandable.
