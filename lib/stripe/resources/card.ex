Possible values: `always`, `limited`, `unspecified`. Nullable.
  * `available_payout_methods` - A set of available payout methods for this card. Only values from this set should be passed as the `method` when creating a payout. Nullable.
  * `brand` - Card brand. Can be `American Express`, `Cartes Bancaires`, `Diners Club`, `Discover`, `Eftpos Australia`, `Girocard`, `JCB`, `MasterCard`, `UnionPay`, `Visa`, or `Unknown`. Max length: 5000.

Format: ISO 4217 currency code. Nullable.
  * `customer` - The customer that this card belongs to. This attribute will not be in the card object if the card belongs to an account or recipient instead. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `cvc_check` - If a CVC was provided, results of the check: `pass`, `fail`, `unavailable`, or `unchecked`. A result of unchecked indicates that CVC was provided but hasn't been checked yet. Checks are typically performed when attaching a card to a Customer object, or when creating a charge. For more details, see [Check if a card is valid without a charge](https://support.stripe.com/questions/check-if-a-card-is-valid-without-a-charge). Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `default_for_currency` - Whether this card is the default external account for its currency.

  * `dynamic_last4` - (For tokenized numbers only.) The last four digits of the device account number. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `exp_month` - Two-digit number representing the card's expiration month.

For payment methods that tokenize card information (Apple Pay, Google Pay), the tokenized number might be provided instead of the underlying card number.

  *As of May 1, 2021, card fingerprint in India for Connect changed to allow two fingerprints for the same card---one for India and one for the rest of the world.* Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `funding` - Card funding type. Can be `credit`, `debit`, `prepaid`, or `unknown`. Max length: 5000.

  * `last4` - The last four digits of the card. Max length: 5000.

  * `networks` - Expandable.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `card`.
  * `regulated_status` - Status of a card based on the card issuer. Possible values: `regulated`, `unregulated`. Nullable.
  * `status` - For external accounts that are cards, possible values are `new` and `errored`. If a payout fails, the status is set to `errored` and [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule) are stopped until account details are updated. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `tokenization_method` - If the card number is tokenized, this is the method that was used. Can be `android_pay` (includes Google Pay), `apple_pay`, `masterpass`, `visa_checkout`, or null. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
