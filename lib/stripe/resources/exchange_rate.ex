  ExchangeRate

  [Deprecated] The `ExchangeRate` APIs are deprecated. Please use the [FX Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/currencies/localize-prices/fx-quotes-api) instead.

  `ExchangeRate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is currently
  using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is variable
  throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to know the current
  rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user with a default
  payment in a foreign currency).

  Please refer to our [Exchange Rates API](https://docs.stripe.com/fx-rates) guide for more details.

  *[Note: this integration path is supported but no longer recommended]* Additionally,
  you can guarantee that a charge is made with an exchange rate that you expect is
  current. To do so, you must pass in the exchange_rate to charges endpoints. If the
  value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please refer to our
  [Using with charges](https://docs.stripe.com/exchange-rates) guide for more details.
