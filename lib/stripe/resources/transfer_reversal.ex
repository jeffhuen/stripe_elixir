  TransferReversal

  [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms can reverse transfers made to a
  connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether
  to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the
  platform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.

  Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination
  charge](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of
  the charge. It is possible to reverse a
  [transfer_group](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options)
  transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the
  reversal.
