  Product

  Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers.
  For example, you might offer a Standard and Premium version of your goods or service; each version would be a separate Product.
  They can be used in conjunction with [Prices](https://api.stripe.com#prices) to configure pricing in Payment Links, Checkout, and Subscriptions.
