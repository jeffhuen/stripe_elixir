  Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.

  The primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can't view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.

  All Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don't change per-user, like a third-party API key.

  A `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.

  * `created` - Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch. Format: Unix timestamp.
  * `deleted` - If true, indicates that this secret has been deleted
  * `expires_at` - The Unix timestamp for the expiry time of the secret, after which the secret deletes. Format: Unix timestamp. Nullable.
  * `id` - Unique identifier for the object. Max length: 5000.
  * `livemode` - Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.
  * `name` - A name for the secret that's unique within the scope. Max length: 5000.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `apps.secret`.
  * `payload` - The plaintext secret value to be stored. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `scope` - Expandable.
