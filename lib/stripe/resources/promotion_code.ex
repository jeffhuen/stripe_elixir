  PromotionCode

  A Promotion Code represents a customer-redeemable code for an underlying promotion.
  You can create multiple codes for a single promotion.

  If you enable promotion codes in your [customer portal configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/configure-portal), then customers can redeem a code themselves when updating a subscription in the portal.
  Customers can also view the currently active promotion codes and coupons on each of their subscriptions in the portal.
  """

  @typedoc """
  * `active` - Whether the promotion code is currently active. A promotion code is only active if the coupon is also valid.
  * `code` - The customer-facing code. Regardless of case, this code must be unique across all active promotion codes for each customer. Valid characters are lower case letters (a-z), upper case letters (A-Z), and digits (0-9). Max length: 5000.
  * `created` - Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch. Format: Unix timestamp.
  * `customer` - The customer who can use this promotion code. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `customer_account` - The account representing the customer who can use this promotion code. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `expires_at` - Date at which the promotion code can no longer be redeemed. Format: Unix timestamp. Nullable.
  * `id` - Unique identifier for the object. Max length: 5000.
  * `livemode` - Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.
  * `max_redemptions` - Maximum number of times this promotion code can be redeemed. Nullable.
  * `metadata` - Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Nullable.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `promotion_code`.
  * `promotion` - Expandable.
  * `restrictions` - Expandable.
  * `times_redeemed` - Number of times this promotion code has been used.
