  Invoice

  Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
  generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.

  They contain [invoice items](https://api.stripe.com#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
  that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).

  If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
  Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
  that finalizing the invoice,
  [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
  not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
  until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
  webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
  connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
  creation to finalize the invoice.

  If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
  [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
  Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
  emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

  Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
  amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
  charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
  per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
  invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
  customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

  More details on the customer's credit balance are
  [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).

  @typedoc """
  * `account_country` - The country of the business associated with this invoice, most often the business creating the invoice. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `account_name` - The public name of the business associated with this invoice, most often the business creating the invoice. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `account_tax_ids` - The account tax IDs associated with the invoice. Only editable when the invoice is a draft. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `amount_due` - Final amount due at this time for this invoice. If the invoice's total is smaller than the minimum charge amount, for example, or if there is account credit that can be applied to the invoice, the `amount_due` may be 0. If there is a positive `starting_balance` for the invoice (the customer owes money), the `amount_due` will also take that into account. The charge that gets generated for the invoice will be for the amount specified in `amount_due`.
  * `amount_overpaid` - Amount that was overpaid on the invoice. The amount overpaid is credited to the customer's credit balance.
  * `amount_paid` - The amount, in cents (or local equivalent), that was paid.
  * `amount_remaining` - The difference between amount_due and amount_paid, in cents (or local equivalent).
  * `amount_shipping` - This is the sum of all the shipping amounts.
  * `application` - ID of the Connect Application that created the invoice. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `attempt_count` - Number of payment attempts made for this invoice, from the perspective of the payment retry schedule. Any payment attempt counts as the first attempt, and subsequently only automatic retries increment the attempt count. In other words, manual payment attempts after the first attempt do not affect the retry schedule. If a failure is returned with a non-retryable return code, the invoice can no longer be retried unless a new payment method is obtained. Retries will continue to be scheduled, and attempt_count will continue to increment, but retries will only be executed if a new payment method is obtained.
  * `attempted` - Whether an attempt has been made to pay the invoice. An invoice is not attempted until 1 hour after the `invoice.created` webhook, for example, so you might not want to display that invoice as unpaid to your users.
  * `auto_advance` - Controls whether Stripe performs [automatic collection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection) of the invoice. If `false`, the invoice's state doesn't automatically advance without an explicit action.
  * `automatic_tax` - Expandable.
  * `automatically_finalizes_at` - The time when this invoice is currently scheduled to be automatically finalized. The field will be `null` if the invoice is not scheduled to finalize in the future. If the invoice is not in the draft state, this field will always be `null` - see `finalized_at` for the time when an already-finalized invoice was finalized. Format: Unix timestamp. Nullable.
  * `billing_reason` - Indicates the reason why the invoice was created.

  * `manual`: Unrelated to a subscription, for example, created via the invoice editor.
  * `subscription`: No longer in use. Applies to subscriptions from before May 2018 where no distinction was made between updates, cycles, and thresholds.
  * `subscription_create`: A new subscription was created.
  * `subscription_cycle`: A subscription advanced into a new period.
  * `subscription_threshold`: A subscription reached a billing threshold.
  * `subscription_update`: A subscription was updated.
  * `upcoming`: Reserved for upcoming invoices created through the Create Preview Invoice API or when an `invoice.upcoming` event is generated for an upcoming invoice on a subscription. Possible values: `automatic_pending_invoice_item_invoice`, `manual`, `quote_accept`, `subscription`, `subscription_create`, `subscription_cycle`, `subscription_threshold`, `subscription_update`, `upcoming`. Nullable.
  * `collection_method` - Either `charge_automatically`, or `send_invoice`. When charging automatically, Stripe will attempt to pay this invoice using the default source attached to the customer. When sending an invoice, Stripe will email this invoice to the customer with payment instructions. Possible values: `charge_automatically`, `send_invoice`.
  * `confirmation_secret` - The confirmation secret associated with this invoice. Currently, this contains the client_secret of the PaymentIntent that Stripe creates during invoice finalization. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `created` - Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch. Format: Unix timestamp.
  * `currency` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). Format: ISO 4217 currency code.

  * `customer_email` - The customer's email. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.email`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `customer_name` - The customer's name. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.name`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated. Max length: 5000. Nullable.

  * `customer_tax_exempt` - The customer's tax exempt status. Until the invoice is finalized, this field will equal `customer.tax_exempt`. Once the invoice is finalized, this field will no longer be updated. Possible values: `exempt`, `none`, `reverse`. Nullable.

  * `description` - An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users. Referenced as 'memo' in the Dashboard. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
