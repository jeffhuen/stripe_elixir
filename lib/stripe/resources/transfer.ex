  Transfer

  A `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as
  part of Connect.

  Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a
  Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split
  out into a [Payout](https://api.stripe.com#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more
  information, read about the
  [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).

  @typedoc """
  * `amount` - Amount in cents (or local equivalent) to be transferred.
  * `amount_reversed` - Amount in cents (or local equivalent) reversed (can be less than the amount attribute on the transfer if a partial reversal was issued).
  * `balance_transaction` - Balance transaction that describes the impact of this transfer on your account balance. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `created` - Time that this record of the transfer was first created. Format: Unix timestamp.
  * `currency` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). Format: ISO 4217 currency code.
  * `description` - An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `destination` - ID of the Stripe account the transfer was sent to. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `destination_payment` - If the destination is a Stripe account, this will be the ID of the payment that the destination account received for the transfer. Expandable.
  * `id` - Unique identifier for the object. Max length: 5000.
  * `livemode` - Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.
  * `metadata` - Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `transfer`.
  * `reversals` - A list of reversals that have been applied to the transfer. Expandable.
  * `reversed` - Whether the transfer has been fully reversed. If the transfer is only partially reversed, this attribute will still be false.
  * `source_transaction` - ID of the charge that was used to fund the transfer. If null, the transfer was funded from the available balance. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `source_type` - The source balance this transfer came from. One of `card`, `fpx`, or `bank_account`. Max length: 5000.
  * `transfer_group` - A string that identifies this transaction as part of a group. See the [Connect documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options) for details. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
