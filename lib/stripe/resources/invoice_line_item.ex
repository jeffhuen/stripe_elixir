  InvoiceLineItem

  Invoice Line Items represent the individual lines within an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) and only exist within the context of an invoice.

  Each line item is backed by either an [invoice item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems) or a [subscription item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_items).
  """

  @typedoc """
  * `amount` - The amount, in cents (or local equivalent).
  * `currency` - Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). Format: ISO 4217 currency code.
  * `description` - An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `discount_amounts` - The amount of discount calculated per discount for this line item. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `discountable` - If true, discounts will apply to this line item. Always false for prorations.
  * `discounts` - The discounts applied to the invoice line item. Line item discounts are applied before invoice discounts. Use `expand[]=discounts` to expand each discount. Expandable.
  * `id` - Unique identifier for the object. Max length: 5000.
  * `invoice` - The ID of the invoice that contains this line item. Max length: 5000. Nullable.
  * `livemode` - Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.
  * `metadata` - Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Note that for line items with `type=subscription`, `metadata` reflects the current metadata from the subscription associated with the line item, unless the invoice line was directly updated with different metadata after creation.
  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `line_item`.
  * `parent` - The parent that generated this line item. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `period` - Expandable.
  * `pretax_credit_amounts` - Contains pretax credit amounts (ex: discount, credit grants, etc) that apply to this line item. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `pricing` - The pricing information of the line item. Nullable. Expandable.
  * `quantity` - The quantity of the subscription, if the line item is a subscription or a proration. Nullable.
  * `subscription` - Nullable. Expandable.
  * `subtotal` - The subtotal of the line item, in cents (or local equivalent), before any discounts or taxes.
  * `taxes` - The tax information of the line item. Nullable. Expandable.
