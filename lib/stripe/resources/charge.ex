defmodule Stripe.Resources.Charge do
  @moduledoc """
  Charge

  The `Charge` object represents a single attempt to move money into your Stripe account.
  PaymentIntent confirmation is the most common way to create Charges, but [Account Debits](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-debits) may also create Charges.
  Some legacy payment flows create Charges directly, which is not recommended for new integrations.
  """

  @typedoc """
  * `amount` - Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).

  * `object` - String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value. Possible values: `charge`.
  * `on_behalf_of` - The account (if any) the charge was made on behalf of without triggering an automatic transfer. See the [Connect documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) for details. Nullable. Expandable.
