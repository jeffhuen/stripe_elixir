  Transfer

  A `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as
  part of Connect.

  Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a
  Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split
  out into a [Payout](https://api.stripe.com#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more
  information, read about the
  [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).
