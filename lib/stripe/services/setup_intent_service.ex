  SetupIntent

  A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
  For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
  Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://api.stripe.com#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

  Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
  Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
  The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
  you through the setup process.

  Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
  For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
  [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
  to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).
  If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://api.stripe.com#setup_intent_object-customer),
  it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
  We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://api.stripe.com#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
  PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

  By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

  Cancel a SetupIntent

  You can cancel a SetupIntent object when it’s in one of these statuses: `requires_payment_method`, `requires_confirmation`, or `requires_action`. 

  After you cancel it, setup is abandoned and any operations on the SetupIntent fail with an error. You can’t cancel the SetupIntent for a Checkout Session. [Expire the Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/expire) instead.

  @doc """
  Confirm a SetupIntent

  Confirm that your customer intends to set up the current or
  provided payment method. For example, you would confirm a SetupIntent
  when a customer hits the “Save” button on a payment method management
  page on your website.

  If the selected payment method does not require any additional
  steps from the customer, the SetupIntent will transition to the
  `succeeded` status.

  Otherwise, it will transition to the `requires_action` status and
  suggest additional actions via `next_action`. If setup fails,
  the SetupIntent will transition to the
  `requires_payment_method` status or the `canceled` status if the
  confirmation limit is reached.
