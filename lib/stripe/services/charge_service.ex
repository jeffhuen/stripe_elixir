  Charge

  The `Charge` object represents a single attempt to move money into your Stripe account.
  PaymentIntent confirmation is the most common way to create Charges, but [Account Debits](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-debits) may also create Charges.
  Some legacy payment flows create Charges directly, which is not recommended for new integrations.

  Capture a payment

  Capture the payment of an existing, uncaptured charge that was created with the `capture` option set to false.

  Uncaptured payments expire a set number of days after they are created ([7 by default](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/charges/placing-a-hold)), after which they are marked as refunded and capture attempts will fail.

  Don’t use this method to capture a PaymentIntent-initiated charge. Use [Capture a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/capture).

  Search for charges you’ve previously created using Stripe’s [Search Query Language](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/search#search-query-language).

  conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up
  to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.
