  Product

  Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers.
  For example, you might offer a Standard and Premium version of your goods or service; each version would be a separate Product.
  They can be used in conjunction with [Prices](https://api.stripe.com#prices) to configure pricing in Payment Links, Checkout, and Subscriptions.

  Search products

  Search for products you’ve previously created using Stripe’s [Search Query Language](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/search#search-query-language).

  conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up
  to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.
