  NotificationEvent

  Snapshot events allow you to track and react to activity in your Stripe integration. When
  the state of another API resource changes, Stripe creates an `Event` object that contains
  all the relevant information associated with that action, including the affected API
  resource. For example, a successful payment triggers a `charge.succeeded` event, which
  contains the `Charge` in the event's data property. Some actions trigger multiple events.
  For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, it triggers both a
  `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.

  Configure an event destination in your account to listen for events that represent actions
  your integration needs to respond to. Additionally, you can retrieve an individual event or
  a list of events from the API.

  [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms can also receive event notifications
  that occur in their connected accounts. These events include an account attribute that
  identifies the relevant connected account.

  You can access events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events#retrieve_event)
  for 30 days.
