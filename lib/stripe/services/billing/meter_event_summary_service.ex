  BillingMeterEventSummary

  A billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer's billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much
  usage was accrued by a customer for that period.

  Note: Meters events are aggregated asynchronously so the meter event summaries provide an eventually consistent view of the reported usage.
