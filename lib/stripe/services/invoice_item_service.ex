  InvoiceItem

  Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices). When you create an invoice item with an `invoice` field, it is attached to the specified invoice and included as [an invoice line item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item) within [invoice.lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).

  Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined
  with a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge
  or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges
  (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.
