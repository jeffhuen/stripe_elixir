  CustomerCashBalanceTransaction

  Customers with certain payments enabled have a cash balance, representing funds that were paid
  by the customer to a merchant, but have not yet been allocated to a payment. Cash Balance Transactions
  represent when funds are moved into or out of this balance. This includes funding by the customer, allocation
  to payments, and refunds to the customer.
