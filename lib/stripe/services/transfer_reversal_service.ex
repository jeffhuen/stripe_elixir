  TransferReversal

  [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms can reverse transfers made to a
  connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether
  to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the
  platform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.

  Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination
  charge](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of
  the charge. It is possible to reverse a
  [transfer_group](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options)
  transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the
  reversal.

  Create a transfer reversal

  When you create a new reversal, you must specify a transfer to create it on.

  When reversing transfers, you can optionally reverse part of the transfer. You can do so as many times as you wish until the entire transfer has been reversed.

  Once entirely reversed, a transfer can’t be reversed again. This method will return an error when called on an already-reversed transfer, or when trying to reverse more money than is left on a transfer.

  You can see a list of the reversals belonging to a specific transfer. Note that the 10 most recent reversals are always available by default on the transfer object.
