  Create a credit note

  Issue a credit note to adjust the amount of a finalized invoice. A credit note will first reduce the invoice’s `amount_remaining` (and `amount_due`), but not below zero.
  This amount is indicated by the credit note’s `pre_payment_amount`. The excess amount is indicated by `post_payment_amount`, and it can result in any combination of the following:

  * Refunds: create a new refund (using `refund_amount`) or link existing refunds (using `refunds`).
  * Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using `credit_amount`) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it’s finalized.
  * Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using `out_of_band_amount`).

  The sum of refunds, customer balance credits, and outside of Stripe credits must equal the `post_payment_amount`.

  You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note may increment the invoice’s `pre_payment_credit_notes_amount`,
  `post_payment_credit_notes_amount`, or both, depending on the invoice’s `amount_remaining` at the time of credit note creation.
