  PaymentRecord

  A Payment Record is a resource that allows you to represent payments that occur on- or off-Stripe.
  For example, you can create a Payment Record to model a payment made on a different payment processor,
  in order to mark an Invoice as paid and a Subscription as active. Payment Records consist of one or
  more Payment Attempt Records, which represent individual attempts made on a payment network.
