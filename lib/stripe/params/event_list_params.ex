  @typedoc """
  * `created` - Only return events that were created during the given date interval.
  * `delivery_success` - Filter events by whether all webhooks were successfully delivered. If false, events which are still pending or have failed all delivery attempts to a webhook endpoint will be returned.
  * `ending_before` - A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list. Max length: 5000.
  * `expand` - Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  * `limit` - A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  * `starting_after` - A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list. Max length: 5000.
  * `type` - A string containing a specific event name, or group of events using * as a wildcard. The list will be filtered to include only events with a matching event property. Max length: 5000.
  * `types` - An array of up to 20 strings containing specific event names. The list will be filtered to include only events with a matching event property. You may pass either `type` or `types`, but not both.
