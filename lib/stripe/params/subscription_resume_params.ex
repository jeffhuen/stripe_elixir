  @typedoc """
  * `billing_cycle_anchor` - The billing cycle anchor that applies when the subscription is resumed. Either `now` or `unchanged`. The default is `now`. For more information, see the billing cycle [documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle). Possible values: `now`, `unchanged`.
  * `expand` - Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  * `proration_behavior` - Determines how to handle [prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) resulting from the `billing_cycle_anchor` being `unchanged`. When the `billing_cycle_anchor` is set to `now` (default value), no prorations are generated. If no value is passed, the default is `create_prorations`. Possible values: `always_invoice`, `create_prorations`, `none`.
  * `proration_date` - If set, prorations will be calculated as though the subscription was resumed at the given time. This can be used to apply exactly the same prorations that were previewed with the [create preview](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/create_preview) endpoint. Format: Unix timestamp.
