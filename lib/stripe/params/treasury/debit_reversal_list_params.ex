  * `ending_before` - A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list.

  * `financial_account` - Returns objects associated with this FinancialAccount.
  * `limit` - A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.

  * `resolution` - Only return DebitReversals for a given resolution. Possible values: `lost`, `won`.
  * `starting_after` - A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
