  @moduledoc "Parameters for subscription list."

  @typedoc """
  * `automatic_tax` - Filter subscriptions by their automatic tax settings.
  * `collection_method` - The collection method of the subscriptions to retrieve. Either `charge_automatically` or `send_invoice`. Possible values: `charge_automatically`, `send_invoice`.
  * `created` - Only return subscriptions that were created during the given date interval.
  * `current_period_end` - Only return subscriptions whose minimum item current_period_end falls within the given date interval.
  * `current_period_start` - Only return subscriptions whose maximum item current_period_start falls within the given date interval.
  * `customer` - The ID of the customer whose subscriptions you're retrieving. Max length: 5000.
  * `customer_account` - The ID of the account representing the customer whose subscriptions you're retrieving. Max length: 5000.
  * `ending_before` - A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list. Max length: 5000.
  * `expand` - Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  * `limit` - A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  * `plan` - The ID of the plan whose subscriptions will be retrieved. Max length: 5000.
  * `price` - Filter for subscriptions that contain this recurring price ID. Max length: 5000.
  * `starting_after` - A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list. Max length: 5000.
  * `status` - The status of the subscriptions to retrieve. Passing in a value of `canceled` will return all canceled subscriptions, including those belonging to deleted customers. Pass `ended` to find subscriptions that are canceled and subscriptions that are expired due to [incomplete payment](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses). Passing in a value of `all` will return subscriptions of all statuses. If no value is supplied, all subscriptions that have not been canceled are returned. Possible values: `active`, `all`, `canceled`, `ended`, `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `past_due`, `paused`, `trialing`, `unpaid`.
  * `test_clock` - Filter for subscriptions that are associated with the specified test clock. The response will not include subscriptions with test clocks if this and the customer parameter is not set. Max length: 5000.
