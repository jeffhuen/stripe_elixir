  * `amount` - If the authorization's `pending_request.is_amount_controllable` property is `true`, you may provide this value to control how much to hold for the authorization. Must be positive (use [`decline`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline) to decline an authorization request).
  * `expand` - Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
  * `metadata` - Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.
